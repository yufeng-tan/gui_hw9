In this assignment, I have completed the following functionalities:
--> The letters are selected randomly from the pieces based on a random number.
--> The letter tiles can be dragged and dropped onto the target Scrabble squares
--> Logically it should identify which letter tile is dropped onto which square since I got stuck in the drop event function, I have difficulty to test this out.
--> The board contains bonus squres
--> Since I got stuck in the last step, I didn't implement the score correctly.
--> The board can be clear by click on a new game button.
